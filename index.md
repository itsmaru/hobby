### Farming

A hobby farm can have different definitions. But the basic idea is that a hobby farm is a small-scale farm that is primarily for pleasure instead of being a business venture. The owner or owners of a hobby farm typically have a main source of income, like an off-farm job, or a pension or retirement income

#### Is hobby farming profitable?


It is obvious that there is much more to this pursuit than making a profit. Hobby farms have represented a significant share of census-farms for many decades. Most operators of hobby farms treat the farm as a “hobby” -- there is no intention of making money. However, some hobby farms are profitable.

##### Plants to Grow on Your One Acre Farm

1.  Potatoes or sweet potatoes.
2.  Beans and peas.
3.  Cabbage and lettuce.
4.  Root vegetables like beets, carrots, and turnips.
